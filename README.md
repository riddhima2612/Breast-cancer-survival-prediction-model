# Breast-cancer-survival-prediction-model
A machine learning model designed to predict breast cancer survival rates based on patient data. This project leverages statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to assist in early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning.

Key Features:

Predicts survival outcomes using patient data such as age, tumor size, and cancer stage
Implements algorithms like [e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost] for accurate predictions
Data preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter optimization for enhanced model performance
Includes visualizations of feature importance and survival trends
Technologies: [e.g., Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn]

How It Works:

Preprocesses and analyzes breast cancer datasets
Trains and evaluates the model using cross-validation techniques
